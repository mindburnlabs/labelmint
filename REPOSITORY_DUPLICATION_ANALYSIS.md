## Section 1: Directory Consolidation Opportunities

### **Test Directories Conflict - Priority: HIGH**
**Directories Involved:**
- `/test/` (minimal setup with vitest mocks)
- `/tests/` (comprehensive Jest setup with MSW)

**Duplication Type:** Structural Conflict
**Similarity Percentage:** N/A - Different testing frameworks
**Impact Assessment:**
- Confusing for developers
- Inconsistent testing patterns
- Maintenance overhead for two different setups
- CI/CD complexity with multiple test commands

**Recommended Action:** Consolidate to single `/tests/` directory
**Implementation Steps:**
1. Migrate useful mocks from `/test/` to `/tests/mocks/`
2. Update all package.json scripts to use `/tests/`
3. Remove `/test/` directory
4. Update CI/CD workflows
5. Update IDE configurations

**Risk Level:** Medium (Testing framework migration required)

---

### **Configuration Scattering - Priority: HIGH**
**Directories Involved:**
- `/config/` (shared configs)
- `/infrastructure/` (infrastructure configs)
- `/database/config/` (database configs)
- Service-level configs in each service
- Multiple docker-compose locations

**Duplication Type:** Structural
**Similarity Percentage:** 60-80% overlap in functionality
**Impact Assessment:**
- Configuration drift
- Difficult to maintain consistency
- Hard to find correct configuration
- Risk of conflicting settings

**Recommended Action:** Consolidate to `/config/` with subdirectories
**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create `/config/docker/` for all docker-compose files
2. Create `/config/monitoring/` for all monitoring configs
3. Create `/config/infrastructure/` for infrastructure configs
4. Update all references
5. Remove scattered config directories

**Risk Level:** Low-Medium (Careful migration required)

---

### **Backup Directory Proliferation - Priority: MEDIUM**
**Directories Involved:**
- Multiple `/backup-*/` directories with timestamps

**Duplication Type:** Structural
**Similarity Percentage:** 95%+ (backup copies)
**Impact Assessment:**
- Repository bloat
- Confusion about active vs backup content
- Storage waste
- Search noise

**Recommended Action:** Remove all backup directories, use git tags
**Implementation Steps:**
1. Confirm all important content is in git history
2. Delete all backup directories
3. Create proper git tags for important milestones
4. Update any documentation referencing backup dirs
