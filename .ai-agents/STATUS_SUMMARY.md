## Critical Findings (Require Follow-Up)

1. **TON payout helpers still stubs**  
   `services/labeling-backend/src/services/tonPaymentService.optimized.ts:732-739` returns `{ success: false, error: 'Not implemented' }`, so blockchain settlement cannot be verified end-to-end.

2. **ApiService never initialised in apps**  
   `packages/ui/src/services/apiService.ts:214-224` expects `initializeApiService(...)`, but no app calls it (confirmed via repo search). `getApiService()` will throw immediately during task fetches.

3. **Wallet UI targets wrong endpoints**  
   Frontend hits `/api/ton/*` (`packages/ui/src/services/tonWalletService.ts:71-177`), while the payment backend exposes `/api/payments/*` (`services/payment-backend/src/api/payments/index.ts`). Need proxy wiring or endpoint rename.

4. **Enterprise analytics placeholders**  
   `services/enterprise-api/src/controllers/AnalyticsController.ts:65-70` hardcodes zeros for task/workflow counts. These should be replaced with real queries or cached aggregates.

5. **Directory metrics placeholder**  
   `services/enterprise-api/src/controllers/DirectoryController.ts:147-170` returns `userCount: 0`. Implement query against synced directory members.

6. **PaymentProcessor external message unimplemented**  
   `contracts/PaymentProcessor.fc:186-189` leaves `recv_external` as `throw(0xffff)`, blocking read-only inspections from tooling.

## What's Working Well ✅

- Enterprise API routes are active (`services/enterprise-api/src/routes/index.ts`); storage quota checks call real metrics (`multiTenant.ts:223-286`).
- TON payment backend exposes wallet and transaction endpoints under `/api/payments` with comprehensive controllers.
- SSO, LDAP sync, and audit logging are operational (`SSOService.ts`, `DirectoryService.ts`, `AuditService.ts`).
- Frontend apps share a polished component library, Telegram Mini App integration, and Socket.IO helpers ready for production use.
- Extensive automated testing already present: blockchain (`tests/blockchain`), backend unit/integration (`tests/unit`, `tests/integration`), E2E (`tests/e2e`), load (`tests/load`), and security suites.
- DevOps stack includes Docker Compose, Terraform, Kubernetes manifests, monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo), and GitHub Actions pipelines.

## Priority Work Breakdown

### Week 1-2 (Unblockers)
- Implement TON payout helpers and contract externals.
- Initialise ApiService in each app entry point; update wallet requests to `/api/payments`.
- Replace analytics/task placeholders with actual queries; surface directory counts.

### Week 3-4 (Integration Pass)
- Add telemetry for the new analytics endpoints and TON payouts.
- Extend E2E and integration tests to cover TON flows, SSO sign-ins, and enterprise dashboards.
- Wire observability & alerting around TON node health and payout jobs.

### Week 5-6 (Polish & Hardening)
- Harden secret rotation & infra automation for TON deployments.
- Round out admin dashboards with real analytics and directory stats.
- Finalise documentation + runbook updates for the new flows.

## Agent Coordination Notes

- **Backend ↔ Blockchain**: Shared ownership of `tonPaymentService.optimized.ts` and smart contract surface (ensure consistent error reporting + retries).
- **Frontend ↔ Backend**: Agree on API bootstrap and wallet endpoint paths before wiring UI callbacks.
- **Enterprise ↔ Backend ↔ Testing**: Analytics and directory metrics must ship with regression tests and monitoring.
- **DevOps ↔ Blockchain**: TON node deployment, monitoring, and secret handling need joint planning.

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] TON payout helper methods return real results and pass integration tests.
- [ ] Every frontend app initialises `ApiService` without runtime errors.
- [ ] Wallet UI communicates with the payment backend endpoints successfully.
- [ ] Enterprise analytics endpoints deliver real counts and storage metrics.
- [ ] Directory API reports actual synced users/groups.
- [ ] Smart contract exposes read-only entrypoints for monitoring tooling.
