## Security Incident Report

### Exposed Credentials (Now Remediated)
The following credentials were exposed and have been cleaned up:

#### Supabase Credentials
- **URL**: `https://bf71rs1supabase.co`
- **Anon Key**: JWT tokens exposed in .env and .env.production
- **Service Role Key**: `sbp_fbf451aa485559cb62e97609ba65697d7f68e0c0`
- **Database URL**: Complete connection string with credentials

#### Telegram Bot Tokens
- **Client Bot**: `8338364850:AAHvSihgG0F3I0NTsDr1SOwTVr8wMQ5BA14`
- **Worker Bot**: `8287639801:AAFWuyqoDINBukvJRraOH1eazk0mLI60xQs`

### Immediate Actions Taken
1. âœ… All real credentials replaced with placeholder values
2. âœ… Updated .gitignore to prevent future commits
3. âœ… Created this security documentation
4. âœ… Flagged for credential rotation

## Secrets Management Policy

### 1. Never Commit Real Credentials
- **RULE**: No real API keys, tokens, or secrets in version control
- **EXCEPTION**: Public keys (non-sensitive) are acceptable
- **ENFORCEMENT**: Automated scanning and .gitignore rules

### 2. Environment File Hierarchy
```
.env                    # Never commit (local development)
.env.development        # Never commit (dev environment)
.env.staging           # Never commit (staging environment)
.env.production        # Never commit (production environment)
.env.example           # âœ… Safe to commit (templates only)
.env.template         # âœ… Safe to commit (templates only)
```

### 3. Credential Rotation Schedule
- **API Keys**: Every 90 days
- **Database Passwords**: Every 180 days
- **JWT Secrets**: Immediately if exposed
- **Bot Tokens**: Immediately if exposed

## Environment Configuration Guide

### Development Setup

1. **Copy Environment Template**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Update with Real Values**:
   - Obtain from secure credential manager
   - Use development-specific credentials
   - Never use production credentials in development

3. **Secure Local Storage**:
   ```bash
   chmod 600 .env
   ```

### Production Deployment

1. **Use Environment Variables**: Set directly in hosting platform
2. **Secret Management Services**:
   - AWS Secrets Manager
   - Google Secret Manager
   - Azure Key Vault
   - HashiCorp Vault

3. **Never Store .env Files** in production containers

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Git Security
```gitignore
# Environment files
.env
.env.local
.env.development
.env.staging
.env.production

# Secret files
*.key
*.pem
*.p12
secrets/
credentials/

# Database files
*.db
*.sqlite
*.sqlite3

# IDE files with secrets
.vscode/settings.json  # May contain API keys
```

### 2. Code Security
- âœ… Use environment variable validation
- âœ… Implement proper secret rotation
- âœ… Log security events (without exposing secrets)
- âœ… Use secure defaults for all configurations

### 3. Infrastructure Security
- âœ… Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- âœ… Use IAM roles instead of access keys when possible
- âœ… Implement network segmentation
- âœ… Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Required Actions for Development Team

### IMMEDIATE (Within 24 hours)

1. **Rotate All Exposed Credentials**:
   - Supabase: Generate new API keys and tokens
   - Telegram: Create new bot tokens
   - Update any additional services that used these credentials

2. **Update Production Environment**:
   - Replace old credentials in production
   - Verify all services are functioning
   - Monitor for unusual activity

3. **Team Security Briefing**:
   - Review this security incident
   - Reinforce secrets management policies
   - Implement mandatory security training

### SHORT TERM (Within 1 week)

1. **Implement Automated Security Scanning**:
   ```yaml
   # GitHub Actions Example
   - name: Scan for secrets
     uses: trufflesecurity/trufflehog@main
     with:
       path: ./
       base: main
       head: HEAD
   ```

2. **Set Up Secret Management**:
   - Choose a secret management solution
   - Migrate all production secrets
   - Update deployment scripts

3. **Update CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Add secret scanning to all PRs
   - Block commits with exposed credentials
   - Implement automated security testing

### Ongoing

1. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Monthly secret scanning
   - Quarterly penetration testing
   - Annual security assessment

2. **Team Training**
   - Quarterly security awareness training
   - Regular policy updates
   - Incident response drills

## Emergency Contact

If you suspect a security incident:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Revoke exposed credentials
   - Notify security team
   - Document timeline

2. **Report To**:
   - Security Lead: [security@labelmint.it]
   - Development Team Lead: [dev-lead@labelmint.it]
