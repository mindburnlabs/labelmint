# üîê LabelMint Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This security audit was performed on the LabelMint platform to identify and remediate critical security vulnerabilities. The audit identified several high-risk vulnerabilities that have been addressed with comprehensive fixes.

## Vulnerabilities Identified & Fixed

### 1. üö® Critical: Stored XSS Vulnerability
**File:** `apps/telegram-mini-app/src/components/tasks/SentimentAnalysisTask.tsx`
**Risk Level:** Critical
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed

**Issue:** The component used `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to render user-controlled content, allowing malicious script injection.

**Fix Applied:**
- Replaced `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with safe React rendering
- Added DOMPurify dependency for input sanitization
- Implemented text highlighting without HTML injection
- Added input validation for all user inputs

### 2. üö® Critical: Path Traversal Vulnerability
**File:** `services/payment-backend/src/scripts/createTestProject.ts`
**Risk Level:** Critical
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed

**Issue:** Unvalidated file paths allowed directory traversal attacks using `../` sequences.

**Fix Applied:**
- Implemented secure filename sanitization function
- Added path validation with `securePathJoin()`
- Added path traversal detection and prevention
- Restricted file operations to designated directories

### 3. üîí High: Missing Webhook Signature Verification
**Files:** Multiple payment endpoints
**Risk Level:** High
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed

**Issue:** Stripe webhooks were processed without signature verification, allowing request forgery.

**Fix Applied:**
- Implemented comprehensive webhook handler with signature verification
- Added idempotency support to prevent duplicate processing
- Created webhook event tracking and audit logging
- Added rate limiting for webhook endpoints

### 4. üí≥ High: Missing Payment Idempotency
**File:** `services/payment-backend/src/services/payment/BackupPaymentService.ts`
**Risk Level:** High
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed

**Issue:** Payment processing lacked idempotency, risking duplicate charges.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added idempotency keys to all Stripe payment requests
- Implemented payment intent deduplication
- Added metadata tracking for audit trails
