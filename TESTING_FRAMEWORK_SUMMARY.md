## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Adding New Tests
1. Create test file in appropriate `test/` directory
2. Import utilities: `import { vi, describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'`
3. Use factories: `import { createTestUser } from '../fixtures'`
4. Mock services: Automatic via setup files
5. Run with: `pnpm test:unit` or specific environment

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: `test/unit/` - Isolated function and class testing
- **Integration Tests**: `test/integration/` - Service integration testing
- **Frontend Tests**: `test/frontend/` - Component testing with jsdom
