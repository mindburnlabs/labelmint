# OpenSpec Change: Consensus Logic State Machine Formalization

## ID
refactor-004-consensus-state-machine

## Type
refactor

## Status
completed

## Priority
high

## Description
Replace ad-hoc consensus and task state management with formal state machine implementation.

## Context
Current consensus implementation is scattered across multiple files with inconsistent state handling:

### Issues Found
1. **State Logic Spread Across Files**:
   - TaskController: Basic state updates
   - TaskService: Consensus calculation
   - CronService: State transitions
   - Bot handlers: State checks

2. **Missing State Transitions**:
   - No explicit state definitions
   - No state transition validation
   - Inconsistent state checks
   - Race conditions in task assignment

3. **Spec Compliance Issues**:
   - Project spec requires 3-label consensus with 2/3 agreement
   - Current implementation has hardcoded values
   - Honeypot task logic mixed with regular tasks
   - No formal workflow for conflicting labels

## Current State Management Problems

```typescript
// Scattered across files - inconsistent patterns
if (task.completed) { /* one pattern */ }
if (task.status === 'DONE') { /* another pattern */ }
if (task.label_count >= 3) { /* third pattern */ }
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Define State Machine

**1.1 Task State Enum**
```typescript
export enum TaskState {
  CREATED = 'created',
  ASSIGNED = 'assigned',
  IN_PROGRESS = 'in_progress',
  PENDING_REVIEW = 'pending_review',
  CONSENSUS_REACHED = 'consensus_reached',
  CONFLICT_DETECTED = 'conflict_detected',
  RESOLVED = 'resolved',
  COMPLETED = 'completed',
  FAILED = 'failed'
}
```

**1.2 State Transition Map**
```typescript
const stateTransitions: Record<TaskState, TaskState[]> = {
  [TaskState.CREATED]: [TaskState.ASSIGNED],
  [TaskState.ASSIGNED]: [TaskState.IN_PROGRESS, TaskState.FAILED],
  [TaskState.IN_PROGRESS]: [TaskState.PENDING_REVIEW, TaskState.FAILED],
  [TaskState.PENDING_REVIEW]: [TaskState.CONSENSUS_REACHED, TaskState.CONFLICT_DETECTED],
  [TaskState.CONSENSUS_REACHED]: [TaskState.COMPLETED],
  [TaskState.CONFLICT_DETECTED]: [TaskState.ASSIGNED], // Assign additional reviewer
  [TaskState.RESOLVED]: [TaskState.COMPLETED],
  [TaskState.FAILED]: [TaskState.CREATED] // Recreate failed tasks
}
```

### Phase 2: State Machine Implementation

**2.1 State Machine Class**
```typescript
export class TaskStateMachine {
  private state: TaskState
  private readonly consensusRequired = 3
  private readonly consensusThreshold = 2 // 2/3 consensus

  transition(newState: TaskState, context: TransitionContext): boolean {
    if (!this.isValidTransition(newState)) {
      throw new InvalidStateTransition(this.state, newState)
    }

    this.state = newState
    this.onStateChange(newState, context)
    return true
  }

  checkConsensus(labels: Label[]): ConsensusResult {
    const counts = this.countLabels(labels)

    if (labels.length < this.consensusRequired) {
      return { reached: false, confidence: 0 }
    }

    const topLabel = this.getTopLabel(counts)
    const confidence = counts[topLabel] / labels.length

    return {
      reached: counts[topLabel] >= this.consensusThreshold,
      confidence,
      agreedLabel: confidence >= 0.66 ? topLabel : null
    }
  }
}
```

**2.2 Event-Driven Architecture**
```typescript
export class TaskEventBus {
  publish(event: TaskEvent): void
  subscribe(eventType: TaskEventType, handler: EventHandler): void
}

// Usage examples
eventBus.publish(new TaskAssignedEvent(taskId, workerId))
eventBus.publish(new LabelsSubmittedEvent(taskId, labels))
eventBus.publish(new ConsensusReachedEvent(taskId, finalLabel))
```

### Phase 3: Consolidate Consensus Logic

**3.1 Consensus Service**
```typescript
export class ConsensusService {
  async submitLabel(taskId: number, label: Label): Promise<ConsensusResult> {
    const task = await this.taskRepo.findById(taskId)
    const machine = new TaskStateMachine(task.state)

    // Add label
    await this.addLabel(taskId, label)

    // Check consensus
    const labels = await this.getLabels(taskId)
    const result = machine.checkConsensus(labels)

    if (result.reached) {
      await machine.transition(TaskState.CONSENSUS_REACHED, { taskId })
      await this.finalizeTask(taskId, result.agreedLabel!)
    } else if (labels.length >= 3) {
      await machine.transition(TaskState.CONFLICT_DETECTED, { taskId })
      await this.assignAdditionalReviewer(taskId)
    }

    return result
  }
}
```

### Phase 4: Honeypot Integration

**4.1 Honeypot State Handler**
```typescript
export class HoneypotTaskHandler {
  async processHoneypotSubmission(taskId: number, label: Label): Promise<void> {
    const task = await this.getHoneypotTask(taskId)
    const isCorrect = await this.verifyHoneypotLabel(task, label)

    // Update worker accuracy
    await this.updateWorkerAccuracy(label.workerId, isCorrect)

    // Honeypot tasks don't go through consensus
    if (isCorrect) {
      await this.updateTaskState(taskId, TaskState.COMPLETED)
    } else {
      await this.penalizeWorker(label.workerId)
    }
  }
}
```

### Phase 5: Performance Optimizations

**5.1 Redis for State Caching**
```typescript
export class TaskStateCache {
  async cacheState(taskId: number, state: TaskState): Promise<void>
  async getState(taskId: number): Promise<TaskState | null>
  async invalidateState(taskId: number): Promise<void>
}
```

**5.2 Batch Processing**
```typescript
export class ConsensusBatchProcessor {
  async processPendingReviews(): Promise<void> {
    const pendingTasks = await this.getPendingReviewTasks(100)

    await Promise.all(
      pendingTasks.map(task => this.processTaskConsensus(task.id))
    )
  }
}
```

## Impact
- **Improves**: Reliability, maintainability, debugging
- **Reduces**: Race conditions, state inconsistencies
- **Enables**: Easier testing, monitoring, extensions
- **Risk**: Medium - requires thorough testing
- **Effort**: 20-24 hours

## Test Strategy
- State transition unit tests
- Consensus calculation edge cases
- Race condition tests with concurrent submissions
- Performance tests for batch processing
- Integration tests with Redis

## Dependencies
- refactor-001-syntax-errors
- refactor-003-shared-type-consolidation

## Rollout Plan
1. Implement state machine alongside existing code
2. Add feature flag for new state machine
3. Migrate one task type at a time
4. Monitor consensus accuracy
5. Remove old implementation

## Success Criteria
- All state transitions validated
- Zero race conditions in concurrent tests
- Consensus accuracy > 98.5%
- Task processing latency < 100ms
- Clear audit trail for all state changes

## Files to Modify
- `/telegram-labeling-platform/backend/src/services/TaskService.ts`
- `/telegram-labeling-platform/backend/src/controllers/TaskController.ts`
- `/telegram-labeling-platform/backend/src/cron/TaskCronService.ts`
- All bot handlers touching task state

## Metrics to Track
- State consistency errors: Target 0
- Consensus calculation time: < 50ms
- Race condition incidents: Target 0
- Code complexity reduction: 30%

## Notes
This refactor is critical for scalability and reliability. The formal state machine will make the consensus logic much easier to reason about and extend for future features like dynamic consensus thresholds.
