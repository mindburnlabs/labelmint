3. **Code Reviews**: All changes must be reviewed by at least one other agent
4. **Integration Testing**: After completing tasks, run integration tests to ensure compatibility

### **Branching Strategy**
```bash
# Each agent creates feature branches from main
agent-1/security-vulnerabilities
agent-2/frontend-refactoring
agent-3/backend-optimization
agent-4/devops-improvements
agent-5/quality-assurance

# Integration branch for combined features
integration/security-frontend-backend
```

### **Communication Channels**
- **Technical Discussions**: GitHub issues and PR comments
- **Daily Updates**: Slack #labelmint-development
- **Urgent Blockers**: Direct message with escalation
- **Documentation**: Confluence for shared knowledge

### **Success Metrics**
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: 40-60% improvement in load times
- **Quality**: 95% test coverage, zero accessibility violations
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime, zero-downtime deployments
- **Documentation**: 100% API coverage, complete onboarding guide

2. Planned task 2
3. Planned task 3
```

---

### **Final Deliverable**
After completing all assigned tasks, each agent will:
1. Create a summary document of all changes made
2. Update documentation for their area of expertise
3. Create knowledge transfer materials
4. Participate in final integration testing
5. Sign off on their completed work
