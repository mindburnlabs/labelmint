# 🛡️ Solo Developer Security Monitoring Plan

**For**: Single Developer Environment
**Priority**: High-impact, low-maintenance security
**Last Updated**: 2024-10-24

---

## 🎯 Overview

Since you're the sole developer, this plan focuses on **automated, low-effort security** that protects your project without requiring constant manual intervention.

---

## ✅ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (30 minutes)

### 1. Essential GitHub Actions (Already Done ✅)
- [x] **Secret Scanning**: Automated secret detection
- [x] **Dependency Scanning**: pnpm audit integration
- [x] **Container Scanning**: Security vulnerability checks

### 2. Simple Email Alerts (5 minutes)
```bash
# Create a simple email alert system
echo 'export SECURITY_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"' >> .env.local
```

### 3. GitHub Notifications Setup (5 minutes)
```bash
# Enable GitHub notifications for security issues
# Go to: https://github.com/settings/notifications
# Check: "Security" and "Code scanning alerts"
```

## 🤖 AUTOMATED MONITORING SETUP

### Option A: **Free Tier Services** (Recommended)

#### Uptime Robot (Free)
```bash
# 1. Sign up at https://uptimerobot.com
# 2. Add monitors:
#    - https://labelmint.it (30 sec checks)
#    - https://api.labelmint.it (1 min checks)
# 3. Set up email alerts to your-email@example.com
# 4. Get webhook for GitHub Actions integration
```

#### GitHub Status Pages
```bash
# Create simple status monitoring
echo "# LabelMint Status

## Services
- **Main App**: 🟢 Operational
- **API**: 🟢 Operational
- **Enterprise API**: 🟢 Operational

*Last updated: $(date)*" > status/README.md

# Auto-update with GitHub Actions
```

### Option B: **Lightweight Self-Hosted** (Optional)

```bash
# Simple monitoring script (2 files only)
# File: scripts/simple-monitor.sh
#!/bin/bash
sites=("https://labelmint.it" "https://api.labelmint.it")
email="your-email@example.com"

for site in "${sites[@]}"; do
  if ! curl -sf "$site" > /dev/null; then
    echo "🚨 $site is down!" | mail -s "Site Down Alert" "$email"
  fi
done

# Add to cron:
# */5 * * * * /path/to/scripts/simple-monitor.sh
```

---

## 📊 DASHBOARD SETUP (15 minutes)

### Grafana Cloud (Free)
```bash
# 1. Sign up at https://grafana.com/products/cloud/
# 2. Create free account (up to 3 users, 10k metrics)
# 3. Add your application metrics endpoint
# 4. Import pre-built security dashboard
```

### Application Metrics (Add to your services)
```typescript
// Add to all Express services
import express from 'express';

const app = express();

// Simple security metrics
const securityMetrics = {
  failedLogins: 0,
  rateLimitHits: 0,
  errors: 0,
  uptime: Date.now()
};

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (req.path === '/health') {
    res.json({
      status: 'ok',
      uptime: Date.now() - securityMetrics.uptime,
      metrics: securityMetrics
    });
    return;
  }
  next();
});
```

---

## 🚨 EMERGENCY RESPONSE (Single Developer)

### Quick Incident Response (10 minutes)
1. **GitHub Actions Manual Trigger**:
   ```bash
   # If you detect a security issue
   gh workflow run security-incident.yml \
     -f incident_type=suspicious_activity \
     -f severity=high \
     -f description="Potential security issue detected"
   ```

2. **Emergency Checklist**:
   - [ ] Check GitHub Actions security scan results
   - [ ] Review recent commits for security issues
   - [ ] Scan dependency vulnerability reports
   - [ ] Check application logs for suspicious activity
   - [ ] Update any exposed credentials (see SECURITY.md)

### Emergency Isolation (If needed)
```bash
# Quick deployment rollback
git revert HEAD~1
git push origin main

# Or disable affected service
# Update environment variables to disable features
```

---

## 📱 MOBILE ALERTS (5 minutes)

### GitHub Mobile App
```bash
# Install GitHub mobile app
# Enable push notifications for:
# - Security alerts
# - Code scanning
# - Dependabot alerts
# - Workflow failures
```

### Simple Email Forwarding
```bash
# Set up email forwarding to your phone
# Gmail: Settings → Forwarding → Add phone number
# Create filter for security alerts
```

---

## 🔄 DAILY SECURITY ROUTINE (5 minutes)

### Automated Daily Security Check
```yaml
# Add to .github/workflows/daily-security.yml
name: Daily Security Check
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * *'  # Daily at 9 AM

jobs:
  daily-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Quick security scan
        run: |
          npm audit --audit-level=high
          # Send summary email if issues found
```
